# Tindog

## Description

Tindog is an App that mimics some functionality of the known dating app tinder. But unlike the "real Version" it is ment for dogs to find their significant other. So far there are some "profile pictures" stored in a data file, that can be liked and disliked. Liked Dogs are stored and can be viewed as long as the app is not resetted. 

There are plans for the future to add more functionality so the UX is more like a real dating app with user profiles etc.
